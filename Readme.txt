Crosstalk resistant adaptive noise canceller. Takes a stereo wav file (an example from Prof Mark Girolami will be on this repositary) and separates the two speakers.
It uses cross-coupled least-mean squares which is not optimal though does seem to work for many cases.
Output can be saved or played within the program.
